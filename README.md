# Statistical-Analysis-in-Financial-Risk-Assessment-using-Python
This project investigates the performance of a stock trading strategy based on moving averages. We utilize Microsoft's historical data (2015-2018) to evaluate the strategy's effectiveness in predicting stock price movements.
Here are the key aspects covered:

Strategy Implementation: Implemented a simple strategy where a buy/hold position is taken if the 10-day moving average exceeds the 50-day moving average.
Performance Evaluation: Assessed the strategy's performance by calculating metrics like returns and potential profitability.
# Statistical Analysis:
Confidence Intervals: Employed confidence intervals to estimate the population mean return of the strategy with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 90%).
Hypothesis Testing: Conducted hypothesis tests to determine if the strategy's average return is statistically different from a specific benchmark (e.g., market return) or zero. This helps assess the strategy's validity.
Normality and Distribution Testing: Evaluated the normality of stock returns and potentially used t-distributions if normality assumptions were violated.
